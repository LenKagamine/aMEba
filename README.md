Life Simulation Game

A simple life simulation game in Java

There are two game modes: Survival mode, and God mode

In survival mode, the objective is to live as long as possible. The player contolled organism can move through environment, eating berries and other organisms in order to replenish their life bar, which depletes due to enemy and slowly depletes over time due to hunger. As you consume other organisms, their DNA will be added to yours, improving stats such as speed. TIP: Slow down and avoid others, as hunger scales up faster then the other stats, so your organism will starve if it becomes too big. Try to use berries instead.
Controls: Move the organism by shifting the mouse cursor and attack by clicking the mouse when the image overlaps another	

In god mode, you are given free rein over an environment of organisms. Change the rate of which berries and enemies spawn, spawn individual enemies and berries, change the landscape with rocks to block organisms, and destroy everything as you please.
Controls: Interact with the buttons at the top of the screen to achieve various effects. Click on the screen to spawn things. Scroll by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen.
